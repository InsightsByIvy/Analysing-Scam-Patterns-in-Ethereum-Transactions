# Analysing-Scam-Patterns-in-Ethereum-Transactions

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Ethereum blockchain transactions to identify patterns associated with scam or fraudulent activity. Using public datasets and the Etherscan API, the project explores transaction behaviors, highlights suspicious addresses, and demonstrates basic compliance analytics techniques.

## Objectives
Collect and organize Ethereum transaction data, including known scam addresses.

Explore and visualize transaction patterns.

Identify features that may indicate fraudulent or suspicious activity.

Lay the groundwork for future compliance or scam-detection models.

## Data Sources
Kaggle Ethereum Datasets: For historical transactions and labeled fraud data.

Etherscan API: For live and historical transaction data.

Public scam address lists (e.g., EtherScamDB, EthScamCheck).

Powered by Etherscan.io APIs.
